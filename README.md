# PvJ-tabletop-gameboard
Gameboard / dashboard for  ProsVsJoes team tabletop exercises for workstream management and team coordination

It is a good advantage to run tabletop exercises in person. However, that is not always possible. So this game board was developed to use over screensharing video conferencing.

The game facilitator opens the gameboard.html file, stored locally, in his browser and then shares that window with the group. The facilitator will be clicking the various controls to change the statuses and move the game forward round by round.

## Other materials needed
A standard deck of playing cards.

## To Run The Tabletop Exercise

1. Assemble the team that will be playing in the event. Discuss strengths and who wants to manage which server.
Recommended arrangement is to have a primary, secondary, and padwan for each server.
This exercises only has five servers, in the real game this will be more like ten to fifteen servers.

2. Have the players discuss how they will prioritize and coordinate tasks during the game.

3. Then start by loading the gameboard in your browser and sharing your screen.

4. Determine how many rounds the group will play. Any subsequent re-plays intended to improve should be run for the same number of rounds so that the scores can be compared.

5. Click the "Next Round" button to start off all services as up and the team getting 5 points for each UP server.

#### Now play each round of the simulation by these steps:
1. **Draw a playing card to determine what the red team will do.** 
See the "Red Team Action Cards Table" below and lookup the result. If the Red Team attacks a server, click the "UP" status button on the attacked server to change the status to "DOWN". You will see a Fix Time number appear; that is the number of rounds the server will take to fix. The fix time will automatically decrease with each click of the Next Round button **only if** there is someone assigned to that server fix task. Let the group determine who will work on it and when (hopefully now, but if everyone is already busy, remember that player cannot work on two servers at the same time!)
**Click the "Unassigned" button once someone has been assigned to fix this server.** This will change the status to "Assigned". 
Also note that players can pair-up and collaborate on a server fix, which solves the problem in half the time. Shift-click on the "Assigned" status button to change it to "Collab" and this will reduce the Fix Time by two rounds each round instead of one per round.
2. Continue to assign players to the DOWN servers until all assignments that can be made have been made.
3. **Click the "Next Round" button and go back to step 1 of the round play.**
Repeat until the pre-determined rounds have been played.

Yes the Red Team will be attacking servers every round as per the card draw. The blue team will quickly become busy.

If you draw a card that says a server has been "borked", then shift-click the "DOWN" status on that server to change it to "BORKED" status. Borked servers cannot be fixed with time; they will require a restore / reset.

## To complete the Exercise
After completing the predetermined number of rounds, take note of the final score and ask the team how they could improve the score next time. Facilitate a discussion of deciding the strategies and tactics the team wants to use on PvJ game day to maximize focus, support, information sharing, and collaboration on tasks.

Write down the team decisions and write them up in an email or playbook. Review them at the game table on the morning of Day 1 of the PvJ event. Play, fine tune, and adjust the battle plan as needed!
